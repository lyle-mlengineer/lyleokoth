## About Me
I am a passionate Machine Learning Engineer with 5+ years of experience in designing, building and deploying speech based web services. This include speech transcription, translation and synthesis.

My background in in software development, with 5+ years of experience in both front end and backend development as well as in data engineering. I focus on solving problems, right from the identification of the challenge at hand, formulating the bussiness solution, UI/UX design to coding and shipping the finished product as well as taking feedback from our end users.

I have 3+ years of experience working with the latest transformer based large language models both for language modelling as well as audio and image generation. I have trained and finetuned these llms and is quite conversant with techniques like Lora and quantization. My focus is on the training and finetuning of diffusion based and flow-matching models for speech syntheis especially for the deverse kenyan languages. I also work on language translation especially live speech to speech translation.

My goal is to build fast and accurate speech models that make content creations easy as well as to enable cross-communication across different cultures. Check out some of the projects I've worked on including models and datasets on my Github page as well as on Huggingface using the links provided.
